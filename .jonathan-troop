    A class is a specific style that you want to reuse throughout the page. an id is a more specific style that will only be used once. For example, 
    each paragraph in the body would take the same class for style, but the side fun-fact text will only be used once and need different stylings for
    aesthetic purposes, and hence would use id.

    20. How do we select classes in CSS?

    section .box p {
        css stuff here
    }

    the repo using the steps in #36. After that, go to pull requests on github and select your TL as a reviewer for your git. 

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    A block element starts on a line and takes up the entire space. examples include <p> <footer> and <div>.

    An inline element doesn't start a new line and only takes up as much width as it uses. exmaples include <span> <button> and <img>

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

    The element is positioned to its nearest closest relative, but does not have to adhere to the positioning of everytthing else in that section. It also gives 
    the flexibility to position the element wherever you want to display it, even overlapping other elements. 

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    I would identify the element the content is in, and add a width property in css to it. I could set it to a fixed width, such as 600px, or a % of the width (or a mix of both). 
    This should ensure that the conent will fit within a width and wrap down to fill itself as necessary.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    Display block: <table></table> <nav></nav> and <form></form> 
    Display inline: <script></script> <strong></strong> and <a></a> 
    Display inline-block: none, from what I could come up with. It is a CSS property and allows to give width and height to an inline element. Often used for
    horizontal positioning. 

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

    The box model refers to the several layers surrounding any content box. On the outside is the margin, which can be more thought of as space around the box.
    Next, the border can be of any (reasonable) width or color and is the outline of the box. Next padding is the space between the border and the content. 
    It takes on the background color of the content box. Lastly, nested inside of this all is the content box, which is where text, images, and video will go.
    These boxes can be maniuplated and fine tuned to make a near infinite possibility of unique web pages.

    According to https://pressupinc.com/blog/2014/01/whats-wrong-css-box-model-fix/, the box model doesn't handle width and other sizing/scaling very well. 
    On good fix is to use the box-sizing:border-box property, which solves some of these issues by setting the width as the total including the padding and border.
